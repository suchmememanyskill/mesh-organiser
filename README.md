## Structure breakdown

The app knows 4 layers of organisation:
- Model: A singular 3d model of any kind
- Group: A collection of 3d models with a strong relationship (like multiple parts of a bigger model)
    - Groups their contents are not intended to be edited after creation. Use Labels for this goal.
- Label: A collection of 3d models with a weak relationship (like multiple models/groups of the same type; like 'wall art' or 'puzzle')
    - Labels thier contents can be edited at any time using the label dropdown menu on groups, models or a collection of models.
- Project: A collection of groups needed to complete a project. Also offers a folder to store instructions (.pdf), or other misc files.

## Additional features

    - Request more via the [Issues tab](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/mesh-organiser/issues)
- Deduplicates imported models using a hash
    - Importing the same model twice will not duplicate it; it'll be registered as the same model
